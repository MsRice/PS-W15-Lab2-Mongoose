## Overview

Lab 2 - Mongoose Models and Schemas

### Scenario

A local library wants to modernize its book tracking system. They have hired you to build the backend for a new “Digital Bookshelf” application. Your first task is to create a RESTful API that allows librarians to manage their book inventory. This API must support creating new book records, viewing the list of all books, finding a specific book by its ID, updating a book’s information, and removing a book from the collection.

## Built with

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB Atlas
- MongoDB Node.js Driver
- dotenv


## Reflection
1. Why is it beneficial to separate your routes, models, and database connection into different directories?
-- 

2. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH HTTP methods, and which one does your PUT /:id endpoint more closely resemble?
-- 

3. In the DELETE route, what is a good practice for the response you send back to the client after a successful deletion? Should you send the deleted object, a simple success message, or something else? Why?
